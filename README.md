# Summer Project 2025: Medical Applications of Nuclear Physics

This repository contains a comprehensive nuclear physics analysis toolkit for studying proton-induced nuclear reactions on metal foils for medical isotope production. The codebase implements uncertainty propagation, cross-section analysis, and counting time optimization for gamma-ray spectroscopy experiments.

## Overview

The project analyzes proton beam activation of layered target stacks containing gallium (Ga) and tin (Sn) foils with copper (Cu) and nickel (Ni) monitor foils. The analysis determines optimal counting times for detecting produced radioisotopes using high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors.
